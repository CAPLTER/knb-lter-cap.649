The CAP LTER maintains a 23 m urban eddy flux tower in the west Phoenix, AZ neighborhood of Maryvale (-112.1426 W, +33.4838 N). The tower is instrumented for long-term measurement of the covariance of turbulent eddy and radiative fluxes for the purposes of urban micrometeorological research. Additional micrometerological parameters, such as precipitation, are also measured. Select soil parameters were measured from 2012 through 2016. Eddy covariance data are collected and stored at two temporal resolutions: 10 Hz and 30-minute averages. Data presented here includes only 30-minute averages. Owing to large volumes, 10 Hz data are avialable only by request to the CAP LTER Information Manager (caplter.data@asu.edu).
